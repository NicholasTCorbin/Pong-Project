# Pong-Project
ECE 351 Group Final Project

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Git for Windows, I know :(
2. Create a "351 Project" folder in your C: drive. So: C:\351 Project\
	-This location is chosen because in order for the project to be uploaded on git, we must have a consistent location for it.
3. Run git clone <url> in C:\351 Project\

Load project as a normal project from there!
Because of the .gitignore, only required files should be uploaded. However, if anything breaks, whether random files are being uploaded, or line formatting is messed up, let me know.
